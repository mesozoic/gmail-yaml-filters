# gmail-yaml-filters

[![Build Status](https://github.com/mesozoic/gmail-yaml-filters/workflows/Tests/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/mesozoic/gmail-yaml-filters/actions?workflow=Tests)

A quick tool for generating Gmail filters from YAML rules.

Interested in helping? See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a few guidelines.

## Getting Started

By default, the command line script will generate XML to stdout, which
you can then upload to Gmail yourself:

```bash
$ pip install gmail-yaml-filters
$ gmail-yaml-filters my-filters.yaml > my-filters.xml
```

## Synchronization via Gmail API

If you are the trusting type, you can authorize the script to
upload new filters and remove obsolete filters via Gmail's API.
Before using any of these commands, you will need to create
[`client_secret.json`](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred)
and store it in the same directory as your YAML file.

```bash
# Upload all filters (and create new labels) from the configuration file
$ gmail-yaml-filters --upload my-filters.yaml

# Delete any filters that aren't defined in the configuration file
$ gmail-yaml-filters --prune my-filters.yaml

# Do both of these steps at once.
$ gmail-yaml-filters --sync my-filters.yaml

# See what would happen but don't apply any changes.
$ gmail-yaml-filters --dry-run --sync my-filters.yaml
```

## Sample Configuration

```yaml
# Simple example
-
  from: googlealerts-noreply@google.com
  label: news
  not_important: true

# Boolean conditions
-
  from:
    any:
      - alice
      - bob
      - carol
  to:
    all: [me, -MyBoss]
  label: conspiracy

# Nested conditions
-
  from: lever.co
  label: hiring
  more:
    -
      has: 'completed feedback'
      archive: true
    -
      has: 'what is your feedback'
      star: true
      important: true

# Foreach loops
-
  for_each:
    - list1
    - list2
    - list3
  rule:
    to: "{item}@mycompany.com"
    label: "{item}"

# Foreach loops with complex structures
-
  for_each:
    - [mailing-list-1a, list1]
    - [mailing-list-1b, list1]
    - [mailing-list-1c, list1]
    - [mailing-list-2a, list2]
    - [mailing-list-2b, list2]
  rule:
    to: "{item[0]}@mycompany.com"
    label: "{item[1]}"
-
  for_each:
    - {list: list1, domain: example.com}
    - {list: list2, domain: whatever.com}
  rule:
    to: "{list}@{domain}"
    label: "{list}"
```

## Configuration

Supported conditions:

* `has` (also `match`)
* `does_not_have` (also `missing`, `no_match`)
* `subject`
* `list`
* `labeled`
* `from`, `to`, `cc`, and `bcc`
* `category`
* `deliveredto`
* `filename`
* `larger`
* `smaller`
* `size`
* `rfc822msgid`
* `is` and `has` work like [Gmail's search operators](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en), for example:
  * `has: attachment` is translated to `match: "has:attachment"`
  * `is: -snoozed` is translated to `no_match: "is:snoozed"`

Supported actions:

* `archive`
* `forward`
* `important` (also `mark_as_important`)
* `label`
* `categorize`, smart labels for Gmail's category tabs. Supported values:
  * `^smartlabel_personal` (Primary tab)
  * `^smartlabel_social` (Social tab)
  * `^smartlabel_promo` (Promotions tab)
  * `^smartlabel_notification` (Updates tab)
  * `^smartlabel_group` (Forums tab)
* `not_important` (also `never_mark_as_important`)
* `not_spam`
* `read` (also `mark_as_read`)
* `star`
* `trash` (also `delete`)

Any set of rules with `ignore: true` will be ignored and not written to XML.
